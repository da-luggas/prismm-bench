      "Evaluation Metric Weaknesses: The evaluation metrics used to assess LLMs' QA performance lack robustness. The current scoring prompt only accounts for completeness, accuracy, and relevance, which are insufficient for open-ended questions. Recent studies (e.g., RAGchecker [NeurIPS 2024]) suggest including metrics like faithfulness (to detect hallucinations), truthfulness, correctness, etc. Additionally, prompts should be specifically designed with definitions and in-context examples to help LLMs understand each metric. Without refining the prompt and using comprehensive evaluation metrics, the reported performance scores are likely unreliable. This contradicts the earlier statement that the paper reports reliable performance scores.",

This seems to be more an artifact of keeping the boundary conditions fixed. And I also don't believe the trade-off (longer time = more traj distortion but greater velocity 'smoothness') is general - already in your plot we see that when going from T=4 to T=5 the trajectory gets more distorted, but also the velocity peak on the right (t = 3.2 and 3.7) becomes worse (i.e., the trajectory needs to accelerate drastically towards the end to achieve the boundary constraints), which seems to invalidate the claim in the paper."
